Discuss an architectural decision with me: $ARGUMENTS

Your role is to help me think through this decision rigorously before documenting it.

Start by understanding the problem:
- What problem are we solving? What are the constraints?
- What options exist? (Help me identify ones I might have missed)

Then challenge my thinking:
- Play devil's advocate on my preferred approach
- Ask about edge cases, failure modes, and long-term implications
- Push back if my reasoning seems weak or hand-wavy

When we've had a real discussion and I'm ready, I'll say "write it up" - then create the ADR at docs/architecture/decisions/NNN-<slug>.md with:
- Status (Accepted)
- Context (the actual problem and constraints we discussed)
- Decision (what we chose and the real reasoning)
- Consequences (honest trade-offs, not just pros)

Until I say "write it up", keep discussing. Don't rush to document.
