Create an Architecture Decision Record for: $ARGUMENTS

Ask me:
1. What decision was made?
2. What alternatives were considered?
3. Why did we choose this approach?

Then write an ADR with sections:
- Status (Accepted)
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences (what's easier, what's harder)

Save to: docs/architecture/decisions/NNN-<slug>.md                            
(increment NNN from the highest existing number)
